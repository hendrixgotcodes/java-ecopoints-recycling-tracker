# EcoPoints Recycling Tracker

This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Apply object-oriented programming to design Household and RecyclingEvent classes using encapsulation.

- Construct and manage ArrayList and HashMap collections to store multiple households and their recycling events.

- Use Java's Date and Time API to track household join dates and recycling dates.

- Implement console-based input handling to register households and log recycling activity.

- Apply conditional logic and loops to process user choices and navigate program options.

- Handle invalid inputs and file-related errors using Java's exception handling.

- Use Java File I/O and serialization to persist and reload program data.

- Generate reports that summarize total recycled weight and eco points across households.
